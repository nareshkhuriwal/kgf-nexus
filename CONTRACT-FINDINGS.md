# Contract findings from Phase 1 implementation

Issues agents raised against the frozen contract. Per CONTRACT.md agents
REPORT rather than edit, so divergences get reconciled centrally here.

Proto/gen changes are deferred until all Phase 1 agents finish: regenerating
`gen/` mid-flight would break every in-progress build.

## Open — needs a contract change

### F1. `Edge.output_to_input` is named backwards from its semantics
**From:** dag-engine · **Severity:** naming only, no behaviour change
The comment says "key = downstream input name, value = upstream output name",
which is the reverse of what the field name reads as. The comment describes the
correct direction and implementations follow it: a downstream input has exactly
one source, while one upstream output may fan out to many inputs — so keying by
*input* is the direction that is actually a function. Keying by output would
require a repeated value and could not express fan-out to two inputs of the
same downstream node.
**Resolution:** rename to `input_from_output` in the next proto revision.
Semantics stay as documented. Tracked; not urgent, since every implementation
already follows the comment.

### F2. `TIMED_OUT` / `LOST` are attempt states, not node states
**From:** dag-engine · **Severity:** doc inconsistency
Architecture §5.2 lists `TIMED_OUT` in the run-disqualifying set, but the node
enum has no such member (nor `LOST`) — both are *attempt* states.
**Resolution (adopted):** a retry-exhausted `TIMED_OUT` or `LOST` attempt folds
to a **FAILED node**, matching §5.2's "terminally failed after retries
exhausted". Implemented in `AttemptStateToNode`. Architecture §5.2 should say
this explicitly.

### F3. §5.2 has no rule for an all-terminal run containing CANCELLED and no failure
**From:** dag-engine · **Severity:** genuine gap; a judgement call the doc must settle
Neither SUCCEEDED nor FAILED is truthful for a run whose nodes are terminal
with at least one CANCELLED and zero failures.
**Resolution (adopted):** return `CANCELLED`. Rationale: the run did not
achieve its goal, so SUCCEEDED is a lie; nothing broke, so FAILED misdirects
the operator to hunt a non-existent fault. Architecture §5.2 needs this rule
added.

### F4. No DAG-engine gRPC service in the frozen proto
**From:** dag-engine · **Severity:** real gap
`proto/` defines only `WorkerService`, yet ADR-0011 requires every service to
expose a gRPC API. The agent hand-wrote a `grpc.ServiceDesc` for
`nexus.v1.DagEngineService` (MaterializeRun / ReconcileRun / ValidateSpec) with
a JSON codec, isolated to one file so a generated stub is a drop-in replacement.
**Resolution:** add `proto/nexus/v1/services.proto` covering the internal
service APIs (dag-engine, workflow-manager, resource-manager, event-service)
once agents are done, then regenerate and swap out the hand-written descriptor.

## Resolved

### F5. `go.mod` Go directive vs CONTRACT.md
CONTRACT.md says Go 1.27 (toolchain is 1.27.1); `go.mod` says `go 1.25.0`.
Not a defect: the `go` directive is a *minimum language version*, not the
toolchain, and 1.25.0 is a deliberately conservative floor that still builds on
1.27.1. No change needed; CONTRACT.md's "Go 1.27" means the toolchain in use.

## Ownership clarification (not a defect)

### task_attempts: creation vs mutation
ADR-0011 assigns `task_attempts` to the scheduler; architecture §3.2/§5.1 say
PENDING attempts are created by the DAG engine. Read literally these conflict.
**Resolution (adopted):** split on the *concern*, not the table.
- **CREATION** of a PENDING row is a dependency decision — only the engine
  knows the graph and trigger rules. DAG engine owns it.
- **MUTATION** from PENDING onward (state CAS, lease, reservation, worker
  assignment) is a scheduling decision and must stay inside the §5.3 atomic
  claim the no-double-dispatch guarantee rests on. Scheduler owns it.
- **Retry attempts** (attempt_number+1) are the scheduler's, since they arise
  from retry policy rather than dependency logic.
These never contend: the engine only INSERTs rows in PENDING and never UPDATEs;
the scheduler only UPDATEs from PENDING onward and never INSERTs an initial
attempt. No row is written by both in the same state, so no lost update.
**Actionable:** the dag-engine's Postgres grant on `task_attempts` must be
`INSERT` only — table-level, satisfying ADR-0011's "enforced by the database,
not code review" requirement.
